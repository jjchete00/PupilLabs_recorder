# PupilLabs_recorder

'''
These archives were used to practice my python abilities and understanding of the Pupil Core Algorithm. Inside each of them there are some explanations in spanish of what they do.
As a summary: 
- simulacion.py reads the .csv that you get when in /exports/000 which contains all of the algorithm data and stores it in a dictionary.
- data_with_app.py accesses the web applications API, extracts all of the algorithm data in real time and prints it in the python terminal.

cheers!
